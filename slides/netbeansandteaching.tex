\subsection{Write or type}
\begin{frame}{No one can write properly these days\ldots}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Proper and beautiful writing with a quill was once an art with
    much appreciation.
  \item Nowadays you can even teach without having a proper handwriting.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Proof is in front of you\ldots
    \end{itemize}

  \item So who am I to expect my students to have a proper hand in writing?

  \item Note: using a pencil and paper~\footnote{White board, whatever} to make a sketch before you start
    writing/coding, even if you throw the sketch away in the process is
    still a best practice.
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What tool}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item So you have your students study programming and use an IDE in parallel.
