  \begin{description}[short]
  \item[Simplification] Prime the sticks generically, with just student ID, not
    student meta data.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item + Simpler handing out of sticks.
    \item + Results in less unused sticks.
    \item - make sure you get the association between stick and
      student right. E.g. let them add their id (student number)
      somewhere or register the issued sticks when handing out.
    \end{itemize}
  \item[Security and authenticity] Somehow protect the stick from
    tampering with e.g. a Linux box during an exam. Anything I can do, 
    a smart student could do to.\InlineMwha
    \begin{itemize}
    \item + makes cheating more difficult.
    \item + Simple solution: Make appearance of desktop clearly
      recognizable and unpredictable
    \item - Would need some kind of encryption. Where to store they key?
    \item - probably would impair priming of sticks
    \item - no solution here yet; not yet seriously investigated.
    \end{itemize}
