\section{conclusion}
\begin{frame}{Closing remarks}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item You cannot organize a real exam without supervision. There
    will always be students that try to cheat when given the change.
  \item All presented here is freely available, either by license
    (E.g. netbeans) of by being OSS. See github for some versions of
    the scripts.
  \item In general, the students consider this kind of exam setup \textit{fair}
    and \textbf{more realistic} then a paper programming exam.
  \item The setup is not restricted to Java programming. We do
    database exams in the same way.
  \item (Libre)Office is also installed, so if student handwriting is
    the problem in written exams, consider using an office document or
    \Code{.txt} file as exam document.
  \end{itemize}
